    Dataset for image restoration tasks.

    Args:
        data_dir (str): Root directory of the dataset.
        file_list (str): Path of the file that contains relative paths of source and target image files.
        transforms (list): Data preprocessing and data augmentation operators to apply.
        num_workers (int|str, optional): Number of processes used for data loading. If `num_workers` is 'auto',
            the number of workers will be automatically determined according to the number of CPU cores: If 
            there are more than 16 cores, 8 workers will be used. Otherwise, the number of workers will be half 
            the number of CPU cores. Defaults: 'auto'.
        shuffle (bool, optional): Whether to shuffle the samples. Defaults to False.
        sr_factor (int|None, optional): Scaling factor of image super-resolution task. None for other image 
            restoration tasks. Defaults to None.
