# Remote Sensing Open Source datasets

PaddleRS is a curated collection of ** open source ** deep learning datasets commonly used in the remote sensing field, providing the following information for each dataset: dataset description, image information, annotation information, source location, and link to AI Studio backup.
These datasets can be categorized by task type into ** image classification, image segmentation, change detection, object detection, object tracking, multi-label classification, image generation ** and many more. Currently included remote sensing datasets are:

* 32 image classification datasets;
* 40 object detection datasets;
* 70 image segmentation datasets;
* 28 change detection datasets;
* 7 instance-split datasets;
* 3 multi-label classification datasets;
* 9 object tracking datasets;
* 3 image captioning datasets;
* 8 image generation datasets.
