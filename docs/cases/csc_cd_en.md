### Competition Background

Mastering the utilization of land resources and the types of land cover is an important content of the census and monitoring of geographical national conditions. Efficient acquisition of accurate and objective land use and monitoring of land change can provide support for national and local geographic information decision-making. With the development of remote sensing and sensor technology, especially the popularization of multi-temporal high-resolution remote sensing image data, we can master the subtle changes of any global surface without leaving our homes.

At present, the field of remote sensing has stepped into the fast lane of high resolution image, and the demand for remote sensing data analysis and application services is increasing with each passing day. The traditional method is poor in characterizing features of high-resolution satellite remote sensing images and relies heavily on manual experience. With the rise of artificial intelligence technology, especially the image recognition method based on deep learning has been greatly developed, and related technologies have also promoted the changes in the field of remote sensing. Compared with the traditional visual interpretation method based on human crowd tactics, remote sensing image recognition technology based on deep learning can automatically analyze the types of ground objects in images, showing great potential in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

The problem from baidu OARS and [buaa LEVIR team](http://levir.buaa.edu.cn/) set together, require participants to use baidu AI Studio platform for training framework based on the localization of AI -- baidu fly oar PaddlePaddle framework for development, Design and develop a WEB system which can realize automatic interpretation of remote sensing images by deep learning technology.

### Task Description

In the part of change detection, participants are required to realize building change detection in multi-temporal images by using the training data provided. Specifically, the task of building change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing images is given two remote sensing images of the same position (geographic registration) taken at different times, which requires locating the area of building change.

## Model Training and Inference

This project USES [PaddleRS](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleRS) suite building model training and inference framework. PaddleRS is a remote sensing processing platform developed based on flying paddlers, which supports common remote sensing tasks such as remote sensing image classification, target detection, image segmentation and change detection, and can help developers more easily complete the whole process of remote sensing deep learning applications from training to deployment. In terms of change detection, PaddleRS currently supports nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, and complex training and reasoning processes are encapsulated in several apis to provide an out-of-the-box user experience.

```python
# Call the PaddleRS API to build the model
model = pdrs.tasks.BIT(
    # Number of model output categories
    num_classes=2,
    # Whether to use mixed loss function, the default is to use cross entropy loss function training

    use_tokenizer=True,
    # token length
    token_len=4,
    # If the tokenizer is not used, the token is obtained using pooling. This parameter sets the pooling mode, with 'max' and 'avg' options corresponding to maximum pooling and average pooling, respectively
    pool_mode='max',
    # Width and height of the pooled output feature graph (pooled token length is the square of pool_size)
    pool_size=2,
    # Whether to include positional embedding in Transformer encoder
    enc_with_pos=True,

    # Number of attention modules used by the Transformer decoder
    dec_depth=8,
    # The embedded dimensions of each attention head in the Transformer decoder
    dec_head_dim=8
)
```

### Dataset Construction

```python
# Build the data transform needed (data enhancement, preprocessing)
# Compose a variety of transformations using Compose. The transformations contained in Compose will be executed sequentially in sequence
train_transforms = T.Compose([
    # Random cutting
    T.RandomCrop(
        # The clipping area will be scaled to this size
        crop_size=CROP_SIZE,
        # Fix the horizontal to vertical ratio of the clipped area to 1
        aspect_ratio=[1.0, 1.0],
        # The ratio of length to width of the cropped area relative to the original image varies within a certain range, with a minimum of 1/5 of the original length to width
        scaling=[0.2, 1.0]
    ),
    # Perform a random horizontal flip with a 50% probability
    T.RandomHorizontalFlip(prob=0.5),
    # Perform a random vertical flip with a 50% probability
    T.RandomVerticalFlip(prob=0.5),
    # Data normalization to [-1,1]
    T.Normalize(
        mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
        std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
    )
])
eval_transforms = T.Compose([
    # In the verification phase, the original size image is input, and the input image is only normalized
    # The method of data normalization in the verification phase and the training phase must be the same
    T.Normalize(
        mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
        std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
    )
])

# 实例化数据集
train_dataset = pdrs.datasets.CDDataset(
    data_dir=DATA_DIR,
    file_list=osp.join(DATA_DIR, 'train.txt'),
    label_list=None,
    transforms=train_transforms,
    num_workers=NUM_WORKERS,
    shuffle=True,
    binarize_labels=True
)
eval_dataset = pdrs.datasets.CDDataset(
    data_dir=DATA_DIR,
    file_list=osp.join(DATA_DIR, 'val.txt'),
    label_list=None,
    transforms=eval_transforms,
    num_workers=0,
    shuffle=False,
    binarize_labels=True
)
```

### Model Training

With AI Studio Premium hardware configuration (16G V100) and default hyperparameters, the total training time is about 50 minutes.

If the VisualDL logging function is enabled during training (enabled by default), you can view the visualized results on the Data Model Visualization TAB. Set logdir to the vdl_log subdirectory in the `EXP_DIR` directory. A tutorial on using VisualDL in a notebook is available [here](https://ai.baidu.com/ai-doc/AISTUDIO/Dk3e2vxg9#visualdl%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7).

It should be noted that PaddleRS used mIoU to evaluate the optimal model on the verification set by default, while F1 scores were selected as the evaluation index by the race official.

In addition, PaddleRS reports indicators for each category in the verification set. Therefore, for Category 2 change detection, category_acc, category_F1-score and other indicators have two data items, which are reflected in the form of lists. Since the change detection task focuses on the change classes, it makes more sense to observe and compare the second data item of each metric (the second element of the list).

```python
# If the lab directory does not exist, create a new one (recursively create the directory)
if not osp.exists(EXP_DIR):
    os.makedirs(EXP_DIR)
```

```python
# Build the learning rate scheduler and optimizer

# Develop a learning rate attenuation strategy with a fixed step size
lr_scheduler = paddle.optimizer.lr.StepDecay(
    LR,
    step_size=DECAY_STEP,
    # The learning rate attenuation coefficient, which is specified here to be halved each time
    gamma=0.5
)
# Construct the Adam optimizer
optimizer = paddle.optimizer.Adam(
    learning_rate=lr_scheduler,
    # In PaddleRS, the paddle.nn.Layer type networking can be obtained using the net property of the ChangeDetector object
    parameters=model.net.parameters()
)
```

```python
# Call the PaddleRS API to implement one-click training
model.train(
    num_epochs=NUM_EPOCHS,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    train_batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    save_interval_epochs=SAVE_INTERVAL_EPOCHS,
    # Log every number of iterations
    log_interval_steps=10,  
    save_dir=EXP_DIR,
    # Whether to use an early stopping strategy, stopping training early when accuracy does not improve
    early_stop=False,
    # Whether to enable VisualDL logging
    use_vdl=True,
    # Specify a checkpoint from which to continue training
    resume_checkpoint=None
)
```

### Model Inference

Using AI Studio Premium hardware configuration (16G V100) and default hyperparameters, the total reasoning time is about 3 minutes.

The inference script uses the fixed threshold method to obtain the binary change map from the change probability graph. The default threshold is 0.5, and the threshold can be adjusted according to the actual performance of the model. Of course, you can switch [Otsu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/otsu/16252828?fr=aladdin)、[k-means clustering](https://baike.baidu.com/item/K%E5%9D%87%E5%80%BC%E8%81%9A%E7%B1%BB%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95/15779627) and other more advanced threshold segmentation algorithms.

The result of model forward inference is stored in the out subdirectory under the `EXP_DIR` directory, and the files in this subdirectory can be packaged, renamed and submitted to the competition system. Please read the [Submission Specification](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/151/0/submit-result) carefully before submitting your results.
