# Model Zoo

PaddleRS' base model library originates from the PaddleCV development kits: [PaddleClas](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas/blob/release/2.3/docs/en/algorithm_introduction/ImageNet_models_en.md), [PaddleSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/blob/release/2.4/docs/model_zoo_overview.md), [PaddleDetection](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection/blob/release/2.3/README_en.md) and [PaddleGAN](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleGAN/blob/develop/README.md). In addition, PaddleRS also contains a series of models specially designed for remote sensing tasks, which can be used for remote sensing image segmentation, change detection, etc.
